                                            founded the Indian Mathematical Society. Impressed by the young man’s works, Aiyer sent him with letters of introduction to R. Ramachandra Rao, the district collector for Nellore and the secretary of the Indian
                                            Mathematical Society. After that Rao, though initially skeptical of the young man’s abilities soon changed his mind after Ramanujan discussed elliptic integrals, hypergeometric series, and his theory of divergent
                                            series with him. Rao agreed to help him get a job and also promised to financially fund his research </p>

                                            Ramanujan began a correspondence with the acclaimed English mathematician, Godfrey H. Hardy</p>

Even though he had no knowledge of the modern developments in the subject, he effortlessly worked out the Riemann series, the elliptic integrals,
                                            hypergeometric series, and the functional equations of the zeta function.

                                            method.
